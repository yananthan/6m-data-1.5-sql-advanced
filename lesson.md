## 🏃 Part 1: The Map and the Bridge (55 min)

### Concept Overview

**The Analogy:** Imagine you are at a party. You have a list of names (client) and a list of who brought which gift (claim).

- **Inner Join:** Only people at the party who brought a gift.
- **Left Join:** Everyone at the party; if they didn't bring a gift, the "gift" column is just an empty box (NULL).
- **Union:** Putting two lists of names (e.g., Employees and Contractors) into one long "Staff" list.

### 🛠️ Workshop

Open DbGate and create a new connection to `db/unit-1-5.db`.

**"Before we build the bridge, we need to know the terrain. Let's look at our 'Card Catalog'."**

#### List and Describe Tables

To list all the tables in `main`:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

You should see 4 tables: `address`, `car`, `claim`, `client`.

For more details:

```sql
SHOW ALL TABLES;
```

To view the schema of an individual table:

```sql
DESCRIBE address;
```

> **Exercise 1:** Describe the other 3 tables. Study their column names and data types.

#### Summarize Tables

```sql
SUMMARIZE address;
```

> **Exercise 2:** Summarize the other 3 tables. Study their min, max, approx_unique, avg and std (if applicable).

#### Joins and Unions

The ERD of the database:

```dbml
Table claim {
  id int [pk]
  claim_date varchar
  travel_time int
  claim_amt int
  motor_vehicle_record int
  car_id int
  client_id int
}

Table car {
  id int [pk]
  resale_value int
  car_type varchar
  car_use varchar
  car_manufacture_year int
}

Table client {
  id int [pk]
  first_name varchar
  last_name varchar
  email varchar
  phone varchar
  birth_year int
  education varchar
  gender varchar
  home_value int
  home_kids int
  income int
  kids_drive int
  marriage_status varchar
  occupation varchar
  address_id int
}

Table address {
  id int [pk]
  country varchar
  state varchar
  city varchar
}

Ref: claim.car_id > car.id
Ref: claim.client_id > client.id
Ref: client.address_id > address.id
```

`car_id`, `client_id`, and `address_id` are foreign keys.

**The 4 common types of joins:**

##### Inner Join

Returns only the rows that match in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim
INNER JOIN car ON claim.car_id = car.id;
```

> Inner join claim and client.
>
> Inner join client and address.

##### Left Join

Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim
LEFT JOIN car ON claim.car_id = car.id;
```

##### Right Join

Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim
RIGHT JOIN car ON claim.car_id = car.id;
```

##### Full (Outer) Join

Returns all rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim
FULL JOIN car ON claim.car_id = car.id;
```

> Return a joined table containing `id, claim_date, travel_time, claim_amt` from claim, `car_type, car_use` from car, `first_name, last_name` from client and `state, city` from address.

##### Union

A union combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set. The queries must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.

`UNION` removes duplicate rows. Use `UNION ALL` to keep duplicates.

```sql
-- Example syntax (not for this database)
SELECT * FROM employees
UNION
SELECT * FROM contractors;
```

> **Question:** "If I SUMMARIZE the claim table and see a max(claim_amt) that is 10x higher than the average, what does that tell you about our insurance risk?"

**Exercise 3:**

Create a master report of every claim. Include the client's name, their car type, and the city they live in.

> Hint: You will need to join 4 tables.

<details>
 <summary>Solution for Exercise 3</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  cl.id, cl.claim_date, cl.claim_amt,
  c.car_type,
  cli.first_name, cli.last_name,
  a.city, a.state
FROM claim cl
INNER JOIN car c ON cl.car_id = c.id
INNER JOIN client cli ON cl.client_id = cli.id
INNER JOIN address a ON cli.address_id = a.id;
```

</details>

### 💬 Reflection

- When joining tables, which table should you choose as the "Left" table? What is a useful rule of thumb?
- How would a "Full Outer Join" help us find cars that have never been claimed AND claims that (erroneously) don't have a car attached?

## 🏃 Part 2: The Moving Window (55 min)

### Concept Overview

**The Analogy:**

A standard `GROUP BY` is like asking "What is the average height of this class?" and only writing down one line: "Class average height is 1.73 m." You no longer see any individual students.

A **window function** is like keeping every student in the list, but adding extra notes beside each one — "class average height is 1.73 m" or "you are the 2nd tallest in your class" — while all the original student rows stay visible.

### 🛠️ Workshop

#### Running Total

A running total is a cumulative sum: each row shows the sum of all rows from the start up to that row, in a defined order.

| row | claim_amt | running_total |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | 100 | 100 |
| 2 | 50 | 150 |
| 3 | 200 | 350 |
| 4 | 25 | 375 |

```sql
SELECT
  id, claim_amt,
  SUM(claim_amt) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS running_total
FROM claim;
```

With `PARTITION BY` to compute the running total per `car_id`:

```sql
SELECT
  id, car_id, claim_amt,
  SUM(claim_amt) OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY id) AS running_total
FROM claim;
```

> Return a table containing `id, car_id, claim_amt, running_total` from claim, where `running_total` is the running sum of the `claim_amt` column for each `car_id`.

**Exercise 4:** Calculate a running total of insurance payouts over time (ordered by claim_date).

<details>
 <summary>Solution for Exercise 4</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  claim_date, claim_amt,
  SUM(claim_amt) OVER (ORDER BY claim_date) AS running_total
FROM claim;
```

</details>

#### Rank

`RANK()` gives each row a position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, …) within a group, allowing ties to share the same rank and leaving gaps after ties.

```sql
SELECT
  id, car_id, claim_amt,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY claim_amt DESC) AS rank
FROM claim;
```

Ties get the same rank, and the next rank after a tie skips accordingly (e.g., two rows tied at rank 2 are followed by rank 4).

#### Qualify

The `QUALIFY` clause filters rows based on window function results. For example, to find the highest claim per car type:

```sql
SELECT
  cl.id,
  c.car_type,
  cl.claim_amt,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY car_type
    ORDER BY claim_amt DESC
  ) AS rank
FROM
  claim cl
  JOIN car c ON cl.car_id = c.id
QUALIFY rank = 1
ORDER BY
  cl.claim_amt DESC;
```

### 💬 Reflection

- What is the key difference between `GROUP BY` and window functions?
- When would you use `RANK()` vs. `ROW_NUMBER()`?

## 🏃 Part 3: Nested Logic — Subqueries & CTEs (55 min)

### Concept Overview

**The Analogy:**

A Subquery is like a "thought within a thought."

A CTE (Common Table Expression) is like writing down a recipe step before you start cooking — it makes the code readable for humans, not just machines.

### 🛠️ Workshop

#### Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested inside another query.

```sql
SELECT id, resale_value, car_type
FROM car
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT car_id
  FROM claim
);
```

**Correlated Subquery** — the inner query references the outer query:

```sql
SELECT id, resale_value, car_type
FROM car c
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT car_id
  FROM claim
  WHERE claim_amt > 0.1 * c.resale_value
);
```

**EXISTS operator:**

```sql
SELECT id, resale_value, car_type
FROM car c1
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT DISTINCT car_id
  FROM claim c2
  WHERE c2.car_id = c1.id
);
```

**Subquery in FROM** (derived table):

```sql
SELECT car_id, avg_claim_amt
FROM (
  SELECT car_id, AVG(claim_amt) AS avg_claim_amt
  FROM claim
  GROUP BY car_id
) AS avg_claims
WHERE avg_claim_amt > (
  SELECT AVG(claim_amt)
  FROM claim
);
```

#### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

A CTE is a temporary named result set created within a query. Use CTEs when you need to reference the same query multiple times, or to improve readability.

```sql
WITH avg_claims AS (
  SELECT car_id, AVG(claim_amt) AS avg_claim_amt
  FROM claim
  GROUP BY car_id
)
SELECT car_id, avg_claim_amt
FROM avg_claims
WHERE avg_claim_amt > (
  SELECT AVG(claim_amt)
  FROM claim
);
```

Multiple CTEs in one query:

```sql
WITH avg_claims AS (
  SELECT car_id, AVG(claim_amt) AS avg_claim_amt
  FROM claim
  GROUP BY car_id
),
overall_avg AS (
  SELECT AVG(claim_amt) AS overall_avg
  FROM claim
)
SELECT car_id, avg_claim_amt
FROM avg_claims
WHERE avg_claim_amt > (SELECT overall_avg FROM overall_avg);
```

**Exercise 5:** Create a CTE that finds the total claim amount for each car. Then use this CTE to find the cars with a total claim amount greater than the average.

<details>
 <summary>Solution for Exercise 5</summary>

```sql
WITH total_claims AS (
  SELECT car_id, SUM(claim_amt) AS total_claim_amt
  FROM claim
  GROUP BY car_id
)
SELECT car_id, total_claim_amt
FROM total_claims
WHERE total_claim_amt > (SELECT AVG(total_claim_amt) FROM total_claims)
ORDER BY total_claim_amt DESC;
```

</details>

**Exercise 6:** Create a report that shows each claim, the client's name, the car type, and the city. Additionally, include a column showing the rank of each claim by claim amount for each car type. Filter to show only the top 3 claims for each car type.

<details>
 <summary>Solution for Exercise 6</summary>

```sql
WITH ranked_claims AS (
  SELECT
    cl.id,
    cli.first_name,
    cli.last_name,
    c.car_type,
    a.city,
    cl.claim_amt,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.car_type ORDER BY cl.claim_amt DESC) AS rank
  FROM claim cl
  INNER JOIN car c ON cl.car_id = c.id
  INNER JOIN client cli ON cl.client_id = cli.id
  INNER JOIN address a ON cli.address_id = a.id
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_claims
WHERE rank <= 3
ORDER BY car_type, rank;
```

</details>

### 💬 Reflection

- When would you use a CTE instead of a subquery?
- How would a CTE help you identify "problem clients" (those with multiple high-value claims in a short time period)?

## 🎯 Wrap-Up

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Joins let you combine data from multiple tables — always identify which table is your primary subject.
2. Window functions add calculated columns (running totals, ranks) without collapsing row detail — unlike `GROUP BY`.
3. CTEs make complex queries readable by breaking them into named, reusable steps.

**Optional Topics for Self Study:**
- Window Functions: `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`
- Advanced CTEs: Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data
- Performance Optimization: Indexing and query optimization techniques
